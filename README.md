# Battle Agents

A self‑play, deep‑reinforcement‑learning (DQN)–powered 2D fighting simulator built with Pygame and PyTorch. In **Battle Agents**, two fighters learn to battle each other over thousands of rounds—discovering strategies, combos, and even emergent tricks like double‑jumps.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Deep Q‑Networks (DQN):** Each agent has its own 5‑layer neural network (4 inputs → 256, 256, 128, 64 hidden units → 5 outputs).
- **Self‑play training:** Fighters learn by competing against each other, driving an “arms race” of tactics.
- **Emergent behavior:** Watch them invent hit‑and‑run, corner‑trap pressure, timed heavy attacks, and even double‑jumps!
- **Replay buffer & target network:** Stable training with experience replay and periodic target‑network updates.
- **Extensible architecture:** Easily add new actions (dash, block, combos), tweak rewards, or change arena settings.

## 🛠 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/buzzfit/Battle-Agents.git
   cd Battle-Agents
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   
   Recommended (keeps system Python clean):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   . .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the simulator**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

> Note: `torch` is optional unless you run the `DQNController` (training mode). The new controller architecture supports lightweight and remote-controlled play.

4. **Watch the learning** — agents train continuously. After hundreds or thousands of rounds, they evolve sophisticated tactics that you can observe in real time.

*This simulator is fully autonomous: the agents train and play against each other without manual input.*

## ⚙ Technical Details

- **State vector:** `[dx_norm, dy_norm, self_health, opponent_health]` (4 dims)
- **Action space:** 5 discrete actions (idle/move left/move right/jump/light/heavy attack)
- **Reward structure:**
  - +1.0 for a successful hit
  - –0.1 for a missed attack
  - –5.0 on death
- **Network & training:** Adam optimizer (lr=1e-4), γ=0.99, ε-decay from 1.0 → 0.1, replay buffer size=10k, batch=64, target update every 1k steps.

## 📈 Results & Observations

- **Balanced play:** After 400 rounds, agents often split wins 200/200—a near‑perfect draw.
- **Emergent moves:** Learned combos, bait‑and‑punish sequences, and double‑jumps without explicit coding.
